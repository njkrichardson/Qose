## Post-Quantum Cryptography 

The development of mature and performant quantum computing systems puts several conventional cryptographic systems under pressure; famously the widely used RSA 
cryptosystem. In the so-called "Post-Quantum" cryptographic era, different cryptosystem technologies. Qose is a library for severely resource constrained embedded 
environments (e.g., those in which even basic dynamic memory allocation is infeasible) which need secure cryptosystems into the forseeable future. The library is 
built by integrating the [hash-sigs](https://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs) LMS library and integrating it with a commercial quality COSE library called [t_cose](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/t_cose).

## Installation and Dependencies 

Qose depends on [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) the general-purpose tookit for cryptography and secure communication. Qose's core dependency is [Hash-Sigs](https://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs), a full-featured implementation of Leighton-Micali signatures [1] using hierarchical signature systems. Qose provides a simple API for interacting with the underlying hash-sigs implementation, intended to be built upon for integration in `t_cose` (see [Integrating with t_cose]()). 

Qose comes packaged with a simple (GNU) makefile whose compiler flags can be easily modified to point to the appropriate locations of your install of hash-sigs and OpenSSL. 

## Background 

Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. The devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers. Though current quantum computers are too small to outperform usual (classical) computers for practical applications, they are believed to be capable of solving certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. [2]

Therefore, RSA encryption is considered unsafe in the post-quantum era. However, there are still other encryption methods that are proofed safe even with the presence of quantum computers. As an example, the Leighton-Micali Signatures using Hierarchical Signature Systems (i.e., LMS/HSS) is hash-based cryptographic method that fits in the post-quantum environment.

## Demo 

The demo script mirrors the `demo.c` provided in the hash-sigs repository. It utilizes the same underlying functions, although these have been refactored out of a single source file in order to enable integration with `t_cose`. One can run the demo binary (provided for `x86_64` in `/bin/demo`, or compiled first using the Makefile) without arguments in order to see usage: 

```bash
$./demo 
$ Usage:
 ./bin/demo genkey [keyname]
 ./bin/demo genkey [keyname] [parameter set]
 ./bin/demo sign [keyname] [files to sign]
 ./bin/demo verify [keyname] [files to verify]
 ./bin/demo advance [keyname] [amount of advance]
```

## Integrating with t_cose 

This project is a work in progress, we are yet to integrate the cryptosystem we've constructed with `t_cose`. Future work includes the creation and modification of the API requirements listed in `t_cose_crypto.h`. For instance, we could simply modify `t_cose_err_t t_cose_crypto_pub_key_sign()` so that it takes as input our generated key and file then creates a signature (with appropriate `t_cose` error codes). In addition, we could also modify `t_cose_verify` to verify the authentication of the key generated by our scripts. This requires integrating some of the `t_cose` specific `struct` types into the LMS implementations.
