## Post-Quantum Cryptography 

The development of mature and performant quantum computing systems puts several conventional cryptographic systems under pressure; famously the widely used RSA 
cryptosystem. In the so-called "Post-Quantum" cryptographic era, different cryptosystem technologies. Qose is a library for severely resource constrained embedded 
environments (e.g., those in which even basic dynamic memory allocation is infeasible) which need secure cryptosystems into the forseeable future. The library is 
built by integrating the [hash-sigs](https://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs) LMS library and integrating it with a commercial quality COSE library called [t_cose](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/t_cose).
